Blog & site powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)!

Lets see if I keep this one updated...

So I thought the domain `apii.io` was a little different from the domain I have been using for over 10years! And well `.io` is just cool, right?!

Notes to self
- Use markdown to create blogposts and not html..!
- Keep this update (ha!)

Markdown seems a little broken!
