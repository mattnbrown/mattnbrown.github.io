So its been a little while since I past put up a post (wishful thinking keeping on top of this!)

The next little project I will start (and maybe finish this time!) is a C# based digital Skydive Logbook...
Current line of thinking:

- .Net C#
- MySQL DB
- API
- Razor Web Interface
- Xamarin for mobile app

More to follow soon!
